A real-time movie recognition mobile app


### Im trying to upload the backend which contains large folders of extracted frames from movie datasets. 
In Overall,
the app is performs recogniton of frames to an extent, but it needs a lot of movies and their extracted frames. or there i can improve its efficiency by implementing a web reverse search to ensure accuracy of detection. 

I have to put its development on hold because i do not have currently have the resource to continue, nevertheless, i think it is a good idea overall.
